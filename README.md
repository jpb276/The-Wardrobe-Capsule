# The-Wardrobe-Capsule
For Working With Data and Coding Assessment 2

If you’re like me and you love to travel but still struggle to find the perfect clothes to bring with you for your trips, this platform might be perfect for you. The Wardrobe Capsule, as suggested by its name, aims to provide an everyday essential closet guide to travellers going for long or short holidays. As a chronic overpacker, I would love to have a direct vision guide on how I will be styling all the clothes I want to bring with me. 

Inspired by Cher's Outfit Generator from Clueless, this outfit generator is created to make packing for a trip more fun and engaging.
